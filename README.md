# SpaceREP - Mesohacks

The problem SpaceREP solves

Students devote a significant amount of time acquiring new information that will enable them to solve problems in the future. However, 80% of what they learn is forgotten after three days. Spaced Repetition is a learning method used in order to help students remember concepts for a longer period of time. This method is extremely effective in helping people learn a foreign language or remember complicated information, yet it isn't used all too often because it is an unconventional habit to form, and most people believe they will be able to recall the concept they studied now whenever they require it.

Our app employs the concept of Spaced Repetition to help students remember what they have learned for the rest of their lives. Our application will help them recall concepts in as little as 20 minutes per day. We provide a user-friendly interface for students to facilitate the process to enable them to cultivate this habit.

Challenges we ran into

We encountered numerous issues while developing this app.
Firstly, We had no prior experience with FIGMA leading up to this hackathon, so we spent the first day learning the technology and designing the user interface. On the second day, we completed its React implementation.
We had previously used Git for simple personal projects. Given that it was our first hackathon, we encountered numerous challenges while collaborating on a single project. We lost several lines of code while learning how to collaborate using Git. As a result, we had to rewrite multiple lines of code.
Debugging the Login and Register features took a long time because State Management with Redux was challenging.
Making the website responsive was also a challenging task.
We were able to build and deploy the backend of our Heroku-hosted application. However, due to time constraints, we could integrate only some parts with the front end.
